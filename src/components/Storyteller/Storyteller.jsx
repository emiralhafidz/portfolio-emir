        When Iâ€™m not designing, I am a storyteller under the alias of The Tiny
        Wisdom.

      <p className="storyTeller2">
        During the pandemic in 2020, I started to document my thoughts, ideas,
        and feelings and share them online. It began as a blog post but
        eventually evolved into comic strips. I write, draw, and work on social
        media strategies to get people to read my content.

      <p className="storyTeller3">
      Now, The Tiny Wisdom has been sharing stories with over 100k+ people on <span>Instagram</span>, 40k+ people on <span>Twitter</span>, and many more on <span>Medium</span> and my <span>Newsletter Website</span>.
