      <h2>Electrical and Electronics Engineer</h2>
      <p className="textDescription1">
        When I was in vocational high school (SMK), I was already interested in
        learning a lot about electricity and electronics.
      </p>
      <p className="textDescription2">
        I attended SMKN 1 TANGERANG SELATAN with a major in Electrical Power
        Installation Engineering. In my studies, I learned various aspects,
        including creating a single-line diagram for a 3-phase electric motor
        installation, designing circuits for forward reverse, star delta, and
        direct online configurations using PLCs. Further reinforcing my
        knowledge, during my college years, I interned at Schneider Electric,
        where I worked on PLC circuits based on logic gates. I gained a deep
        understanding of single-line diagrams for medium voltage, low voltage
        product panels, and other panels.
